Given N rubber ducks that need to be arranged in a row. Each duck has a specific height and width. We need to arrange the ducks in such a way that the sum of the heights of the used ducks is maximized, and their total width does not exceed the maximum width of the row.

Input: The first line of the standard input contains two integers N and M (1 <= N, M <= 50) separated by a single space, representing the number of available ducks and the maximum width of the row, respectively. Each of the next N lines contains two integers w and s (1 <= w, s <=9) separated by a single space, representing the height (w) and width (s) of a duck.

Output: Your program should print the maximum sum of heights of the used ducks that can be arranged in a row, to the standard output.
